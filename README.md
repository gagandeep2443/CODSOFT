##Data Science (July Batch-1)
It contains 5 tasks
##Task 1 - TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a
passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner
project with readily available data.
The dataset typically used for this project contains information
about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket
class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
